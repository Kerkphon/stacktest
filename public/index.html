						<h1>What is the MEAN Stack?</h1>
						<p>
							The term MEAN stack refers to a collection of JavaScript-based technologies used to develop web applications.
							MEAN is an acronym for MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, and Node.js. 
							From client to server to database, MEAN is full-stack JavaScript.
						</p>
						<br>
						<h2>Node.JS</h2>
                        <p>
							Node.js is similar in design and influenced by systems like Ruby's EventMachine and Python's Twisted. 
							Node.js takes the event model even further. It presents an event loop as a runtime construct instead of as a library. 
							In other systems, there is always a blocking call to start the event-loop. 
							Usually behavior is defined through callbacks at the beginning of a script, and at the end a server is started through a blocking call like EventMachine::run(). In Node.js, there is no such start-the-event-loop call.
							Node.js enters the event loop after executing the input script. 
							Node.js exits the event loop when there are no more callbacks to perform.Node.js hides the event loop from the user.

						<h2>ExpressJS</h2>
                        <p>
							ExpressJS is a web application framework that provides us with a simple API to build websites, web apps and back ends for those websites. 
							With ExpressJS, low level protocols and processes are not a major problem.Express provides a minimal interface to build our applications. 
							It gives us the tools that are required to build the apps we want to build. 
							It is flexible because there are so many modules available on npm, which can be directly plugged into Express. 
							Express is maintained by the Node.js foundation and numerous open source contributors.

						<h2>MongoDB</h2>
                        <p>
							AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. 
							It lets you use HTML as a template language for the projects and apps we build and it also lets us extend the syntax of HTML so we can express our application's components clearly and efficiently. 
							AngularJS's data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code we  would otherwise have to write if we were not using AngularJS.

						<h2>AngularJS</h2>
                        <p>
							MongoDB is an open source database management system (DBMS) that uses a document-oriented database model that supports all kinds of data. 
							It is one of numerous nonrelational database technologies which arose in the mid-2000s for use in very large data applications and processing jobs that involved data that did not fit well in a relational model. 
							Instead of using tables and rows like relational databases,  MongoDB architecture is made up of collections and documents.
